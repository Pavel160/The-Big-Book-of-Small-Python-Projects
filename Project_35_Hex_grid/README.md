# Hexagonal Grid
This project is a program that generates a hexagonal grid, displaying it in the command line or saving it to a text file. The program creates a mosaic of hexagons that can be used for various purposes, such as printing, emailing, or sharing on social media.

## Description
The program creates a grid of hexagons using characters in the command line. By changing constants in the code, you can adjust the size of the hexagons and the number of hexagons horizontally and vertically. The grid can be saved to a text file for further use.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

2. Open the hexgrid.py file in a text editor.

3. Modify the constants X_REPEAT and Y_REPEAT to adjust the number of hexagons horizontally and vertically.

4. To run the program and display the hexagonal grid on the screen, use the following command:

For Windows:

```bash

python main.py
```
For Linux/macOS:

```bash

python3 main.py
```

## Configuration
- X_REPEAT: Number of hexagons horizontally (default is 19).
- Y_REPEAT: Number of hexagons vertically (default is 12).
You can change these values to create a grid with your desired size.

## Example Output
Here's an example of how the generated hexagonal grid might look:
