**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

## Description
The Water Jug Puzzle is a classic problem where you have two jugs of different capacities and the goal is to measure a specific amount of water using the jugs. This Python implementation simulates the puzzle and provides an interactive way to solve it step by step.

## Game Features

1. Two jugs with given capacities (e.g., 5L and 3L).
2. The goal is to measure a specific amount of water (e.g., 4L) using only these two jugs.
3. The solution is provided step-by-step, showing the process of filling, emptying, and transferring water between the jugs.
4. The program can handle various configurations of jug capacities and target amounts.

## Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher.

## How to Solve the Puzzle

1. Run the program:
```bash

python main.py
```
2. The game will prompt you to three buckets (three, five and eight liters) get exactly four liters in one of the buckets.
3. The program will simulate the process, displaying each action (fill, empty, or transfer water) until the target amount is achieved.
4. Follow the step-by-step solution.
