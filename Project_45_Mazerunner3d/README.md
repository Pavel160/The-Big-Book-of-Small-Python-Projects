**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

## Description

This project is a 3D maze that you can view and interact with. The maze is generated using Python, and it is displayed in 3D using libraries like **Pygame** or **PyOpenGL**.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (or PyOpenGL, if used for 3D rendering)

You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

1. You can generate the maze files by following the instructions in Project 44, or simply download them from:

```bash
 https://invpy.com/mazes/.
```

2. Run the maze:

```bash

python main.py
```
## Usage
Once the script is running, the 3D maze will be displayed in a separate window, and you can navigate through it using arrow keys (or any other keys you have set up).
