# Progress Indicator
**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

A simple Python project that shows a progress indicator to track the execution of a long-running task. The progress indicator can be displayed in a variety of formats, such as a percentage or a progress bar.

Tags: progress, indicator, task, automation

## Features
- Progress Bar: Displays a graphical progress bar that fills as the task progresses.
- Percentage Display: Shows the percentage of completion as the task runs.
- Customizable: You can adjust the progress bar style, length, and the interval between updates.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

You may also need to install the tqdm library for more advanced progress bars (optional):

```bash
pip install tqdm
```

## How It Works
1. Task Simulation: The project simulates a task using a loop, and the progress indicator updates based on how much of the task has been completed.
2. Progress Update: You can update the progress using a simple function call. It displays a percentage and a progress bar that shows how much of the task has been completed.
3. Customization: You can change the length of the progress bar or switch to a more detailed progress bar style with the tqdm library.
