# Birthday Paradox
**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

## Description
The Birthday Paradox is a famous probability theory problem that shows that in a group of just 23 people, there is a better than even chance that at least two people share the same birthday. This project simulates the paradox by running multiple simulations and calculating the probability of shared birthdays in a group.

## Features
- Simulates the birthday paradox for different group sizes.
- Runs multiple simulations to calculate the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday.
- Provides a result of the probability based on the number of simulations run.

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Development Environment:** PyCharm or VSCode (optional)

## Project Structure
- `main.py` — main file to run the game.
- `birthday_paradox.py` — contains the game logic.
- `config.py` — project configuration settings.
- `tests/` — folder with tests to verify code functionality.
  - For example, `test_paradox.py` may contain tests to check clues and game logic.

## Running Tests
1. Make sure you are in the project root directory.
2. Run tests using pytest:
   ```bash 
   pytest tests/
