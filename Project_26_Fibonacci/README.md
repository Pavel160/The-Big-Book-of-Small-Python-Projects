# Fibonacci Sequence
**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

**Fibonacci Sequence** is a simple Python program that calculates and displays the Fibonacci numbers. This sequence is one of the most well-known in mathematics, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## Features

- **Calculate Fibonacci numbers** up to a given number `n`.
- **Print the sequence** for visualization.
- Supports both **recursive** and **iterative** methods to calculate the Fibonacci numbers.
- **Efficiency** improvements, including memoization.

### Running the Fibonacci Sequence
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the program using:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. The program will prompt for an integer n and calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.
### Example
For example, if n = 10, the program will output:
```css
Fibonacci sequence up to 10:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
```
### Controls
- The user enters an integer n, and the program will generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.
- You can choose between the recursive or iterative method by setting the appropriate flag or function.

## Fibonacci Methods
- Recursive: The Fibonacci number is calculated using the standard recursive formula: Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2).

- Iterative: A more efficient approach using a loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
