Soroban - Japanese Abacus

**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

The Soroban is a Japanese abacus used for performing mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program simulates a Soroban using a text-based display. It represents a Soroban's beads and allows users to visualize numbers in the traditional Japanese style.

## About Soroban
A Soroban consists of several vertical rods, each representing a decimal place. Each rod is divided into two parts:

- Upper beads: Representing 5 (one bead per rod).
- Lower beads: Representing 1 (up to four beads per rod).
Numbers are formed by positioning the beads near the central bar.

## Features
- Simulates a Soroban display.
- Converts a user-provided number into its Soroban representation.
- Handles large numbers, showing each digit on a separate vertical rod.

## How to Start
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Run the program using the following command:
```bash

python main.py
```
## Exiting
- Type **quit** to leave the program.


## Usage
1. The program will prompt you to input a number.
2. It will then display the Soroban representation of that number.

## Notes
- Only non-negative numbers are supported in this version.
- This program is a simple simulation and does not include functionality for performing calculations.

## Further Improvements
Future enhancements could include:

- Allowing the simulation of actual calculations on the Soroban.
- Improving the graphical representation using libraries like curses for terminal-based visuals.
