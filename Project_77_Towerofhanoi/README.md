## Description
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle. The objective is to move a set of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty rod.
3. The puzzle is solved when all disks are moved to the target rod in the same order.

This Python implementation offers an interactive console-based simulation of the Tower of Hanoi.

## Game Features

- Configurable number of disks (default is 5).
- Displays each step as the disks are moved.
- Allows players to solve it manually

## Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher.
