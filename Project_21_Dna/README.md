# DNA Visualization
Author: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

"DNA Visualization" is a simple yet visually stunning animation that simulates the structure of a DNA double helix. This program uses a text-based representation to create the twisting, rotating effect of the DNA molecule in motion.


Example of the DNA double-helix visualization.

## Features:
- Dynamic Animation: Creates a visually appealing animation of the DNA double helix structure.
- Lightweight: Built using Python's standard library without additional dependencies.
- Customizable Parameters: Change animation speed, strand spacing, and other properties.

## Controls:
Press Ctrl + C to quit the program at any time.

## Example:
The program generates an animated, twisting visualization of a DNA double helix:
   ```bash
        ##      ##  
      ##  ##  ##  ##
    ##      ##      ##
      ##  ##  ##  ##
        ##      ##
   ```

The animation loops indefinitely, creating the illusion of a spinning DNA strand.
