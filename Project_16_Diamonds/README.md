# Diamonds
**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

## Description

The "Diamonds" project generates beautiful diamond-shaped patterns in the console. It allows users to create customizable diamond sizes and styles, making it an excellent tool for learning loops, nested conditions, and pattern generation in Python.

## Features

- Generate diamond shapes of varying sizes.
- Customize the symbols used to draw the diamonds.
- Visualize patterns directly in the terminal or save them to a text file.
- Easy-to-use interface for quick experimentation.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Program**: Run the script using Python.
2. **Input Parameters**: The program will prompt you to enter:
   - The size of the diamond (e.g., the number of rows).
   - The symbol used to create the diamond (e.g., `*`, `#`, or any character).
3. **View the Pattern**: The generated diamond will be displayed in the console.

## Tests
   ```bash
   python tests/
```

## Requirements
Python 3.x+

## Project Structure
- main.py — The main file to start the program.
- rhombuses.py — Contains all the logic for generating diamond patterns.
- README.md — Project instructions and details.
## Example Output
Here’s an example of a diamond pattern generated by the program with a size of 5:
