## Overview
The "DVD Bouncing Logo" project recreates the familiar DVD logo bouncing off the screen edges. Each time the logo hits a wall, it changes direction, creating a classic animation effect.

## How It Works
- A DVD logo starts moving across the screen at an angle.
- Each time it hits a screen edge, it "bounces" and reverses direction horizontally, vertically, or both, depending on which edge it hits.
- Optionally, the logo can change color upon bouncing for a more dynamic effect.
