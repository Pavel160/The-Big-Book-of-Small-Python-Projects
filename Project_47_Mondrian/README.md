# Mondrian Art Generator
**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

This program randomly generates abstract art in the style of Piet Mondrian using ASCII characters and colors. The art is generated by creating black vertical and horizontal lines and filling the resulting rectangles with colors, mimicking Mondrian's signature grid-like style.

## Features
   - Generates art in the style of Piet Mondrian, consisting of black grid lines and colored rectangles.
   - Randomly populates the canvas with vertical and horizontal lines, creating a grid structure.
   - Colors are randomly assigned to the grid sections, with choices between red, yellow, blue, and black.
   - Interactive: after each artwork is generated, the user is prompted to press Enter to generate another piece.

## Requirements
This program requires the bext module for text-based graphics. You can install it via the following command:

```bash

pip install bext
```
If the bext module is not installed, the program will provide instructions for installation and terminate.

## Installation
Clone this repository or download the script.
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install the required bext module by running the command:
```bash

pip install bext
```
## Usage
Run the script to generate a new Mondrian-style artwork. The program will continuously generate new art pieces until you press Ctrl+C to stop or Enter to generate another one.

### Example Run:
```bash

python main.py
```

Upon execution, the script will display an artwork, and then you will be prompted to either:

   - Press Enter to generate another artwork.
   - Press Ctrl+C to quit the program.

## Code Structure
   - Constants: The program defines constants for colors (WHITE, BLACK, RED, YELLOW, BLUE) and the increments for the positions of the vertical and horizontal lines (MIN_X_INCREASE, MAX_X_INCREASE, MIN_Y_INCREASE, MAX_Y_INCREASE).

   - Canvas: The canvas is represented by a dictionary where each key is a tuple of coordinates (x, y), and the value is the color of that pixel.

   - Art Generation: The program generates vertical and horizontal lines across the canvas, then randomly removes certain segments to form different shapes. The rectangles formed by these segments are randomly filled with color.

   - Interactive Loop: After each piece of art is generated, the user is prompted to press Enter to generate another or quit by pressing Ctrl+C.
