# J'ACCUSE! - A Mystery Game

**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

**J'ACCUSE!** is a text-based mystery game where you, as the world-famous detective Mathilde Camus, must solve the case of the missing cat, Zophie. You will gather clues, interrogate suspects, and use your reasoning skills to find out who took Zophie. But beware—some of the suspects are liars, so you will need to carefully analyze their statements to crack the case before time runs out.

## Features

- **Suspects, Items, and Places:** Each character has a different clue about Zophie, and you must use these to piece together the mystery.
- **Liars and Truth-Tellers:** Some suspects will lie, while others will tell the truth. It's up to you to figure out who is who.
- **Time Limit:** You only have 5 minutes to solve the case. The clock is ticking, so act quickly!
- **Multiple Endings:** Depending on your choices, the game will end in different ways—can you solve the case in time and accuse the right person?

2. You will interrogate suspects and ask them about other people, places, and items.
