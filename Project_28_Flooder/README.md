**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

Flooder is a vibrant board game where the goal is to fill the entire board with a single color or shape. Inspired by the game Flood It!, it also includes a mode for colorblind players, making it accessible to a broader audience.

## üéÆ How to Play
1. Objective:
Your task is to make the entire board one color or shape within a limited number of moves.

2. Game Modes:

Color Mode: Play with bright colors like red, green, blue, etc.
Shape Mode: Symbols like ‚ô•, ‚ô¶, ‚ñ≤ replace colors for better accessibility.

3. Rules:

Start from the top-left corner.
On each turn, select a color or shape to flood the adjacent tiles.
Your selection changes the connected tiles to the new color/shape.
Continue until the board is uniform or you run out of moves.

4. Winning Condition:

You win by filling the board with one color/shape before running out of moves.
