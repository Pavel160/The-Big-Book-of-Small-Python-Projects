# Message as a Bitmap Map
**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

This project encodes a text message into a visual representation using a bitmap image. It demonstrates how text can be transformed into a bitmapped structure, combining image manipulation and text encoding techniques.

## Features:
- Convert any string message into a bitmap visualization.
- Customize the dimensions and style of the bitmap.
- Learn basic image manipulation with Python.

## Requirements:
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Development Environment:** PyCharm or VSCode (optional)

## Usage:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script and input your message.
3. View the generated bitmap representation.

## Example
Input:
```
Hello, World!
```

Output: A bitmap image visually representing "Hello, World!" in a black-and-white grid, where each letter is mapped to a pattern of pixels.
