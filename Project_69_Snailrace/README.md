# Snail Race Game

**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

The Snail Race game simulates a race between snails. The goal of the game is to race a group of snails to see which one reaches the finish line first. The race is simulated using random movement for each snail, and the race ends when one snail crosses the finish line.

## Description
The game randomly generates the progress of snails moving towards the finish line. Players can set the number of snails, the track length, and the speed of each snail. The snails will randomly "move" forward in each race step, and the first snail to cross the finish line wins the race.

## Features
- Customizable race settings (number of snails, track length).
- Random snail movements during the race.
- Track progress shown in a simple text format, displaying snails moving toward the finish line.
- Option to start a new race after one finishes.

## How to Start
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed.

3. Run the game by executing the following command in the terminal:
```bash

python main.py
```
## Game Controls
- The game will ask you to input the number of snails (e.g., 5).
- Then you will be asked to enter the names of the snails.
- After that, the race will begin, and you will see the snails racing in a text-based simulation.

## Notes
- The snails' movements are generated randomly for each step.
- The game can be further expanded by adding features such as betting on the snails or creating visual representations of the race using libraries like pygame.
