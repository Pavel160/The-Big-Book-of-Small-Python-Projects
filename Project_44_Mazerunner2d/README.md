# Maze Runner 2D
**Author**: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

**Maze Runner 2D** is a text-based game where you navigate through a maze to find the exit. Mazes are generated using the `mazemakerrec.py` program.

## Game Description
- You control the character `@`, starting at the position marked `S`, and your goal is to reach the exit marked `E`.
- Walls are represented by the `#` symbol, and open spaces by a blank space ` `.
- Movement is controlled using the **W**, **A**, **S**, **D** keys.

## How to Play
1. Download the game source code.

2. You can also download maze files from:

   ```bash
   https://invpy.com/mazes/.

3. Run the `main.py` program:
   ```bash
   python main.py

4. When prompted with "Enter the filename of the maze (or LIST or QUIT):", you can:

   - Type LIST to display all available maze files.
   - Enter the name of a maze file, e.g., maze65x11s67.txt.
   - Type QUIT to exit the game.

5. The maze will be displayed in the console. Move your character using:

   - W — move up.
   - A — move left.
   - S — move down.
   - D — move right.

6. The objective is to reach the exit (E). Once you succeed, the program will automatically end.
