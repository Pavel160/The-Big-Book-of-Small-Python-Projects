# Factorization

This project is a Python implementation for **factorization** of numbers and polynomials. The program can break down numbers into their prime factors and factorize algebraic expressions into simpler components.

## Features

- Prime factorization of integers.
- Polynomial factorization into simpler polynomials.
- Interactive user input for factorization tasks.
- Command-line interface.

Enter the number or polynomial you wish to factorize when prompted.

The program will display the factors or the factorized form of the expression.
